This is serial dot product
------------------------------------------------



Compile: type "make" to compile.

Execute: type "tile-monitor --dev usb0 --resume --here --upload-tile-libs m \
               -- ./dot_serial <vector_size> <nthreads> <no. of iterations> <output log filename>"
               
               64 128 256..... 4096, for a given no. of threads
         
         
Output: The logs are dumped in a logfile you provide, or in case of the automated script, in a file called "nthreads th vsize.csv"
        For axample 4 threads 1024x1024 vector size will create a file called: 4 th 1024.csv
        

Notes:  1. The logfile saves the times in every iteration for all threads, because carlo wanted to study 
           noise in the readings. 
           
        2. This program actually distributes the same vector to all the threads and tyhen logs the compute times 
           for the vector multiplication for all threads in all iterations
           
        3. The main vectors are copied into the threads' local memory to avoid shared memory contentions.
