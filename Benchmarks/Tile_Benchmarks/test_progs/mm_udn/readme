This is matrix multiply using UDN
------------------------------------------------



Compile: type "make" to compile.

Execute: type "tile-monitor --dev usb0 --resume --here --upload-tile-libs m \
               -- ./mm_udn <matrix_size> <nthreads> <no. of iterations> <output log filename>"
               
               
         Alternatively, use "./run_script <matrix_size> <no. of iterations> " to run the experiments for nthreads = 2
         4 8 9 16 25 32 36, for a given matrix size. 
         
         
Output: The logs are dumped in a logfile you provide, or in case of the automated script, in a file called "nthreads th msize.csv"
        For axample 4 threads 1024x1024 matrix size will create a file called: 4 th 1024.csv
        

Notes:  1. The mapping between real and virtual cores is fixed. Also is the datatype (int) 
           you have to change DATATYPE directive in source to change the datatype, 
           and an array called the "list" to change the mapping.
            
        2. The logfile saves the times in every iteration for all threads, because carlo wanted to study 
           noise in the readings. The column format is EVENT_S and EVENT_E and EVENT_D meaning start, end and 
           difference between start and end of the particular event. Example COMPUTE_S is the time when compute starts 
           and so on. This is logged for ALL threads. The output format is csv format
