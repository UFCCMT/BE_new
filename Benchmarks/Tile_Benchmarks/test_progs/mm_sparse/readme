Sparse matrix multiply
---------------------------

Step 1: Initialize marix A and B with random crap (obviously taking care that most of 'em are 0)
Step 2: Convert the matrix A to CSR and Mattrix B to CSC
Step 3: Broadcast the A matrix CSR
Step 4: Scatter the B matrix CSC.
Step 5: Compute.
Step 6: Gather the CSC.
