BE-SST tests:

1. One ArchBEO component - single computation, no Monte-Carlo
    - check for basic correctness
2. One ArchBEO component - single computation, with Monte-Carlo
    - check for basic Monte Carlo correctness
3. One ArchBEO component - series of computations, no Monte-Carlo
    - Check advancement of simulation time
4. One ArchBEO component - series of computations, with Monte-Carlo
    - Check addition of distributions
5. Multiple ArchBEO component - series of computations, no Monte-Carlo
    - Check advancement of simulation time across multiple BEO objects
6. Send-Recv (Blocking send and blocking recv)
    - neighbor (1 hop)
    - end of row/column (longest distance along any one dimension)
    - end of row/column (longest distance along all dimension)
    - longest path in the system (id0 to idN-1)
    - Check using simulated time & simulation trace
7. Send-Recv (Non-blocking send and blocking recv)
    - neighbor (1 hop)
    - end of row/column (longest distance along any one dimension)
    - end of row/column (longest distance along all dimension)
    - longest path in the system (id0 to idN-1)
    - Check using simulated time & simulation trace
8. Send-Recv (Non-blocking send and non-blocking recv) - FUTURE
    - neighbor (1 hop)
    - end of row/column (longest distance along any one dimension)
    - end of row/column (longest distance along all dimension)
    - longest path in the system (id0 to idN-1)
    - Check using simulated time & simulation trace
9. Broadcast - one sends to all (tree broadcast)
10. Scatter - one sends pieces to all (naive scatter)
11. Gather - one collects pieces from all (naive gather)
12. Allreduce - collect from all & add (naive)
13. Barrier - ring/chain barrier
