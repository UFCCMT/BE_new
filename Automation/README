Run by:
	python autogen.py

autogen.py:
	Main file to run. Uses command line arguments to instantiate the correct classes,
then uses generic functions to print to the script.

autogenLib.py:
	Contains the functions for the app and machine. As stated before, autogen calls the
same functions each time, but defines the class depending on the command line arguments.

autogenSelect.py:
	-Alternate implementation run without command line arguments, 
and app/machine are printed out to be selected from.

mpi_examples:
	Just a folder with mpi matrix multiplication for test
