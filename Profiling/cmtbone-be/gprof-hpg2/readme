These are results from hipergator for different number of MPI processes (8,16,32,etc).

The following parameters were used:
  NStep = 5000
  IOStep = 5000
  
The files have been named based on the number of MPI processes used.
For example, logfile_16p.txt implies 16 processes have been used.

Rarefaction is the example (or case) used for cmtnek.
3dbox is the example (or case) used for cmtbone.
